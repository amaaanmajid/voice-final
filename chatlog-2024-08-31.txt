You: could you tell me today's date
 
AI: 
I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or a physical clock. However, I can suggest some ways for you to find out the current date:

1. Check your phone or computer: Most devices display the current date and time on their home screens.
2. Ask Siri or Google Assistant: If you have a virtual assistant like Siri (on Apple devices) or Google Assistant (on Android devices), you can ask them "What's today's date?" and they'll tell you.
3. Check a calendar app: You can open a digital calendar app on your device, such as Google Calendar or Apple Calendar, to see the current date.
4. Look at a physical clock: If you have access to a physical clock, you can check the date printed on it.

I hope that helps!
