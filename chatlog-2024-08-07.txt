You: o mahika
 
AI: 
Mahika! That's a beautiful and powerful term in Sanskrit, often used to refer to the "cosmic energy" or "divine power." It's believed to be the ultimate source of creation and sustenance for all living beings.

In Hindu mythology, Mahika is often depicted as a goddess who embodies the creative force of the universe. She's said to be the one who brings forth life, nourishes it, and ultimately dissolves it back into her cosmic womb.

Mahika is also sometimes associated with the concept of Prakriti (Nature) or Shakti (the feminine aspect of the divine), highlighting the interconnectedness between the macrocosm and microcosm.
